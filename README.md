# Starbound Sign Placer
Place custom signs in one click

# Installation

Download the mod form the site and put it into your mods folder:
> /Starbound/mods/Sign Placer

Download the [Animated Signs generator](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-AnimatedSigns) by Silverfeelin.

# Pre-Usage

Make sure you've stared numerating the signs from `[0,0]`.
After finishing setting up your signs in the generator, press `Create and Export` button. Now, you have to save it inside Sign Placer mod.

Let's say you called the folder "My First Picture". After pressing `Create and Export` button, navigate to
> /Starbound/mods/Sign Placer

and put save your folder there. So the final path will look like
> /Starbound/mods/Sign Placer/My First Picture

Now launch Starbound.

# Usage

In Starbound, open starting crafting menu (`C` by default) and craft Sign Placer: it's totally free!

Now, go to debug mode: open chat and run next command:

> /debug

Usually, you have to gain admin access first, but you can change that by editing starbound.config file

Pressing Right Mouse button will open the User Interface, where you have to write the name of the folder you've put in the mod folder. In addition, you can select how many signs you want to generate (it is count from the bottom left corner).
When you're set, press Accept. If you typed it right, "All done" message will appear. Close the thing, but don't put the item away.

Now, in debug mode you can see your future picture: green polys mean you can place signs here safely, the red ones warns you that signs won't spawn there. When you find your spot, simply press Left Mouse Button, and voila! Profit!
